## Migrating to IBM Z Open Debug v4 from earlier versions

Starting with v4, IBM Z Open Debug uses Zowe connection profiles to define connections to z/OS machines, replacing the connection details that were previously defined in the VS Code Settings. Existing connection details defined in the VS Code Settings can be automatically migrated to a new Zowe team configuration, or added to an existing Zowe team configuration.

IBM Z Open Debug v4 uses a different internal format for storing debug profiles. Debug profiles in older formats can be automatically migrated.

The separate *IBM Z Open Debug Profiles view* extension has been deprecated. All functionality related to debug profiles is now contained in the *IBM Z Open Debug* extension, and the *IBM Z Open Debug Profiles view* extension can be automatically uninstalled.

A prompt will be displayed for each migration step. If desired, old artifacts may be retained after migration to allow continued backwards compatibility with older versions of IBM Z Open Debug.


## Configuring host connection

IBM Z Open Debug defines connections to remote z/OS hosts using [Zowe connection profiles](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/ze-profiles/). A minimal Zowe team configuration file for Z Open Debug might look like:
```json
{
    "$schema": "./zowe.schema.json",
    "profiles": {
        "zOpenDebug": {
            "type": "zOpenDebug",
            "properties": {
                "host": "yourZhost.yourCompany.com",
                "dpsPort": 8143,
                "dpsContextRoot": "api/v1",
                "dpsSecured": true,
                "rdsPort": 8002,
                "rdsSecured": true,
            },
            "secure": [
                "user",
                "password"
            ]
        }
    },
    "defaults": {
        "zOpenDebug": "zOpenDebug",
    },
    "autoStore": true
}
```


## Debug profiles
IBM Z Open Debug provides a user interface in Visual Studio Code for creating and managing debug profiles, which can be used to dynamically trigger IBM z/OS Debugger on z/OS applications. Debug profiles can be created and managed through the *z/OS Debugger Profiles* view (*View* > *Open View...* > *z/OS Debugger Profiles*)



## Launching and debugging applications

IBM Z Open Debug provides several `launch.json` configuration types for working with z/OS Debugger sessions on a remote z/OS host. Launch configurations can be created and triggered through the *Run and Debug* view in order to:

* Launch a z/OS application via a client-side command line, and then automatically connect to it once it is parked on the z/OS host. Use a `launch` config that specifies an `applicationLaunch: commandLine` attribute.
```json
{
    "type": "zOpenDebug",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Launch and debug application",
    "connection": {
        "type": "zowe",
        "name": "myZoweConnection",
    },
    "applicationLaunch": {
        "commandLine": "zowe rse submit data-set \"MYUSER.SAMPLE.JCL(MYDBG)\""
    }
}
```
* List available parked z/OS Debugger debug sessions on a z/OS host (and optionally click to connect to one of them). Use an `attach` config.
```json
{
    "type": "zOpenDebug",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "List and click to connect to available parked debug sessions",
    "connection": {
        "type": "zowe",
        "name": "myZoweConnection",
    }
}
```
* Connect to an available parked z/OS Debugger debug session on a z/OS host. Use a `launch` config.
```json
{
    "type": "zOpenDebug",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Connect to a parked debug session",
    "connection": {
        "type": "zowe",
        "name": "myZoweConnection",
    }
}
```
